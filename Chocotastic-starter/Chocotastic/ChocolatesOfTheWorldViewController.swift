   1. Grab the shopping cart‚Äôs chocolates variable as an Observable.
   2. Call subscribe(onNext:) on that Observable to discover changes to the Observable‚Äôs value. subscribe(onNext:) accepts a closure that executes every time the value changes. The incoming parameter to the closure is the new value of your Observable. You‚Äôll keep getting these notifications until you either unsubscribe or dispose of your subscription. What you get back from this method is an Observer conforming to Disposable.
   3. Add the Observer from the previous step to your disposeBag. This disposes of your subscription upon deallocating the subscribing object.
